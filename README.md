Wordpress Angular Admin
=======================

A boilerplate for Angular driven Wordpress settings pages.

To get a project started, clone this project into your Wordpress plugin folder. Next run "composer install" and "bower install" in the terminal. You must have PHP Composer and Bower (Node.js) installed.  
I hope to provide more documentation later. 

Some of the Wordpress code is based off snippets from here: http://pippinsplugins.com/using-ajax-your-plugin-wordpress-admin/
